# This file is a template on how batch data for jobs can be inserted into
# Nephos. Use  a modification of the file with the
# `--load-jobs` argument to insert batch data to the schedule.
# To add more data, create new dictionary elements with incrementing indexes. 
# "0"  has been created for understanding and should NOT BE altered.
# Multiple values can be entered for single dict key by separation through
# space. Hence do not use space otherwise.
